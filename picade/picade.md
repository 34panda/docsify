## Introduction
## Introduction

The Picade is a retro-feel gaming console that uses a Raspberry Pi as its main component.

It's fairly simple to recreate, requiring a low-to-intermediate level of technical skills for basic configuration and a high-intermediate level for customizations.

It's a great project to undertake and an amazing device to play on.

While the console's body is not ergonomic and its buttons are hard to press, it gets the job done. Although it's of lower engineering quality than consoles designed solely for gaming, its versatility and customization make it a worthwhile project even with these downsides.

Let's start with what we need for it to work:

## Operating System
## ROM games
