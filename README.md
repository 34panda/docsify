Welcome to academical project focusing on Robotics and Internet of Things. This project aims to be a comprehensive guide covering various topics such as GamePi43, Picade, Raspberry Pi Smart Home, and much more.

I've used `Docsify` and `HTML/CSS` to build this interactive and easy-to-navigate documentation website.
